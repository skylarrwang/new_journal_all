Can Yale be Neutral?
In 1970, a non-profit group called
the Project on Corporate Responsibility
sponsored a campaign among
shareholders in General Motors
advocating increased shareholder input
into the formulation of that company's
public policy, and increased attention
to the social and political consequences
of corporate actions. The trustees of
the Yale Corporation, which holds
103,600 shares in GM, abstained from
voting on the shareholder resolutions.
They did so, they explained, " on the
principle that the Fellows of the
Corporation do not, and should not,
have the power to take a corporate
position on issues of a social or political
nature. This principle derives from the
philosophy that a university is a
collegium or forum for the expression
of a wide diversity of views. This
conception is the cornerstone of
academic freedom." In doing so, the
Yale Corporation took the stance that
its investments were "neutral," and
that the mere act of owning and
benefitting from shares in no way
implies support or criticism of a
company's actions. The trustees
maintained that to remain silent is to
remain neutral.
A year later, this statement met with
serious questioning in a seminar
project led by Professor John Simon of
the Law School. The project
formulated a set of guidelines for the
consideration of ethical questions
related to investments. Yale responded
by setting up the University-wide
Advisory Committee on Investment
Responsibility. This body received as
its sole power, however, the task of
reviewing shareholder resolutions
introduced by other shareholders and
advising the Corporation on how it
should vote. The Advisory Committee
has never introduced a resolution of its
own, and its recommendations are not

binding for the Corporation's vote. In
a slightly modified form, Yale
maintained its "neutral" position on
investments.

Yale's investments in companies
operating in the Republic of South
Africa pose a serious challenge to this
stance of neutrality. It is becoming
increasingly obvious that American
investments there both directly and
indirectly support the racist regime of
John Vorster. Examples of direct aid
are well known: IBM (Yale shares
67,650) leases computers to the South
African police and prisons for the
enforcement of the repressive passbook
laws; GM and Ford (Yale shares
103,600and 127,500 respectively)
supply trucks to the military; Citicorp
and J.P. Morgan (Yale shares 36,900
and 35,200) made loans totalling
$110 million to the South African
government in 1976 alone. But the
presence of foreign investment by its
very nature, through the promotion of
capital-intensive-and highly
technological industry, supports the
white regime indirectly by serving only
the needs of the white population.
Ambassador Radha Krishna Ramphul,
upcoming President of the U.N.
Security Council, told the Council in
March of this year,

"It is crystal clear that foreign
investment is not geared to improving
the situation in Southern Africa at
present. Foreign funds are not directed
to agricultural development in the
rural areas or to social programmes
which would benefit the life of
Africans. The South African
government is not using those
funds... to dismantle apartheid in some
absentminded way. To the contrary,
thanks to foreign investment and
foreign loans, the South African
government has been able to build and
maintain a garrison state."

In addition, the recently enacted South
African law requiring foreign concerns
either to produce what the government
orders or to face nationalization of
their assets makes every corporation,
willingly or unwillingly, an accomplice
to the continuation of apartheid.
In view of such evidence, it is plain
that American corporate investment in
South Africa is by no means neutral,
but is a bulwark in the fortress of
apartheid. This fact calls Yale's
supposed neutrality in investments
into serious question. If Yale continues
to reap the benefits of the profits on
oppression in South Africa and
remains silent, can it still claim that it
is taking no stance? Is not this very
silence a position in support of foreign
investment in South Africa, in support
of apartheid?

For those of you who do not speak
Scientist, the title of writer-director
Steven Spielberg's latest feature
describes an intimate inter-planetary
rendez-vous. Close Encounters of the
Third Kind is not a futuristic
documentary about inter-earthling
perversions. Rather, it is an allegorical
sci-fi melodrama about two people
whose intitial, illuminating brief
encounter with a U.F.O. leaves them
haunted by its mysterious shape until
they find cosmic vindication of their
vision. Close Encounters is an
enjoyable minor fantasy on eternal
themes, but Spielberg's theological
premise is shamelessly commercial and
absurdly simplistic. Alas, at the film's
end I found myself quite as lost in the
proverbial stars as I had been when I
hopefully paid my $4.50; and to my
sense of injury at the poverty of the
spiritual transaction was added the
equally enduring (albeit less
existential) insult of actual penury.
After the film opens with the
traditional blinding explosion of white
light, the director thrusts us inside a
Mexican desert sandstorm reminiscent
in ferocity of the Seven Plagues of
Egypt. Here scientists are conducting a
search for clues regarding the existence
of extra-terrestrial life forms. When
an inexplicably contented old man
stammers in Spanish that "the sun has
sung" to him, it is clear to all and
sundry that something is rotten in the
solar system. Spielberg then transports
us to the little house on the prairie in
Muncie, Indiana, where Jillian Guiler
(Milinda Dillon) lives with her toddler
son, Barry. To his mother's horror,
Barry is lured into the night by
seductive extra-terrestrial vibes. She
gives chase and catches him on a
deserted highway where both Guilers
run into Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfus),
a neighbor who claims to have seen an
Unidentified Flying Object. As the
adults stand arguing by the roadside,
several 1977-style flying saucers fly by.
Barry, delighted by the evocative
conical Shape he perceives, trills out,
"Ice cream!" Although Ronni Neary
(Terri Garr) is understandably skeptical
when her husband recounts his
adventures, reports of strange
phenomena all over the world (the
earth) are released shortly, and Roy
and Jillian rightly begin to suspect that
the fault is not in themselves but in
their stars after all.
In one of the picture's most striking
scenes, little Barry is kidnapped by
clouds of fire. Despite his mother's
desperate attempts to keep him locked
in the house while star wars rage
outdoors, he unerringly walks to the
single unlocked door and opens it. The
visual allusion to The Wizard of Oz
becomes manifest: standing on the
threshold of a singing sun, Barry looks
for all the world like Dorothy opening
the door from her black-and-white
Kansas homestead into the infinitely
more vivid polychromatic Land of Oz.
Like a supersonic Pied Piper, the
U.F.O. charms the boy out into the
glare and sweeps him off his feet.
Jillian and Roy become obsessed
with the Shape. She cannot stop
sketching it, while he sculpts it in every
dollop of shaving cream, every
spoonful of mashed potatoes. Each
senses the importance of the cryptic
image, yet neither can break the code.

FRIEND OF INFAMY

on kitchen appliances, and I am tired
of making eggs benedict in my hotpot
and broiling chicken in my popcorn
popper. So I decided that I wouldn't
CROSS the picket line, I'd just try to
DISTRACT the picketers with my lithe
and desirable form. No sooner did I
stroll by in a Balenciaga sizzler than
those obnoxious strikebreakers charged
through the picket line and stole my
thunder. Hey, folks, that ain't no way
to treat a lady! (The one guy who
noticed me later deserted me when he
realized I wasn't a drag queen. I was
only insulted that it TOOK him so
long!) But at least I have learned from
bitter experience to resist the
proddings of my sensitive political
conscience. And not to WASTE my
Balenciaga on SCUM!

If there is one thing out of a million on I heard Bloomsbury got a haircut so I
the face of God's green earth that
excites me to a frenzy of murderous
rage, it is people who exaggerate.
Particularly when the people are wildly
and wantonly exaggerating about one
of my very closest of a close, tightly
knit and devoted circle of intimates. I
hear you, Josie and Colette, because I
had your table bugged at George and
Harry's. And the venomous prattle
that you two pigs were dispensing
about my CHERE AMIE, Edie-well,
it drove me to shed tears of pity into
my Bloody Maria. Edie is NOT a
pervert. It's simply that in Edie's most
private, naughty moods, she
sometimes derives ravenous pleasure
from looking at pictures of little blond
boys. You simply could not
have known that, because she swore
me to strictest confidence and told ME
ALONE. And I only told a few people,
NONE OF WHOM WOULD EVER
SPEAK TO YOU. Spreading vicious
rumors will get you nowhere, girls,
nowhere but down in the big game of
life. OK, case closed; I cannot linger
on these petty gossips but must make
haste and make a little mention of my
dear dear friend VALENTINA
ATHENS, who, you recall, was a star
in her Yale years and has moved on all
too soon into the big and burgeoning
world of "Jool-yahhd," (as those in
the know pronounce it) that famous
music conservatory in the Big Apple.
Your sweet Saratoga checked on
Valentina's progress over a recent
weekend, and I am delirious to report
that she loves New York as much as
New York loves her. And believe me,
New York LOVES her. Every man in
the city, and a lot of the women.
Especially a lot of the ethnic types.
Thank you, Val, for allowing me to
share your progress report with my
readers. Your name is legend, your
fans legion.

STRIKE-AND-JAW BREAKERS
DEPARTMENT: I know you all heard
about those rugged DROLLAIRES who
wore matching T-shirts and made a
beeline in the general direction of
Commons and in the specific direction
of a well-known picket line the other
day. I was there, and I HATE
scene-stealers! To explain: I always
believe it best to take both sides of a
controversial issue. Hence while I feel
the univesity MUST negotiate and the
union MUSTN'T modify its demands,
I am dead against the union's position.
Also, the strike caught me a bit short
stopped by to investigate and took a
little snapshot to share with my
readers. Doesn't her new Mr. Kenneth
cut look DIVINE? And wasn't she
wonderful in Kiss Me, Kate?...to
that callow girl in the crowd at the
showing of Freaks: I don't care if it
WAS Halloween, those gold stiletto
heel shoes are out, out, OUT! It
pained us ALL to kick them into the
closet, dear-why should YOU be any
different?

Which
reminds me, the annual Scarsdale
Royalty pageant is approaching and
there's no paucity of regal gals who
need escorts! My girlfriends ask that all
you richer Yale guys put down the law
briefs for an evening and squire one of
these young lovelies. Only $30 for the
evening, $10 extra for a good night
smooch. "Some signs of

miss it, guys-I hear the Deep Freeze
Cotillion is going to be something else
this year!

also paid a call upon my close friend

ROBERT FINE PRESENTS A UNIQUE TASTE EXPERIENCE
FROM CALIFORNIA

The ancestry of the Zinfandel grape is somewhat of a mystery. Intro-
duced to California in the mid-1800's, the grape probably originated
somewhere in Europe, perhaps Italy. Nevertheless it is today considered
a wine unique to California.
For years, Zinfandel was dismissed as a rather ordinary varietal well
suited for jug wines and blending. Recent vintages, however, have
produced a wine that is truly excellent and distinguished.
Wide variations exist among wines labeled Zinfandel. Since Zin-
fandel grapes raisin easily in warm climates, it is at its best in the cool
north coast vineyards. Zinfandels range from light fruity wines which
are quite drinkable when only a few years old to big inky-black wines
rich in tannin that will require many years of bottle age to reach their
peak. We suggest you try one of these fine selections currently available:

Audio-Visual History

"Many believe television is a passing
threat, of which people will soon tire,
just as they tired of staying up half the
night with headsets for the wonder of
getting Peoria in the early days of
radio."-Frank Capra, 1949

The twin threats of radio and
television have not passed.
The average male viewer will watch
TV for over 3000 entire days—
roughly nine full years of his life. If
you feel that you are deficient in this
respect, a decade at the Museum of
Broadcasting should bring you up to
standard.

On November 9, 1976, The
Museum of Broadcasting was
established at 1 East 53rd Street under
a personal grant from William S. Paley
as "the first American museum
dedicated to the study and
preservation of the more than fifty-year
history of radio and television
broadcasting." So far, over 16,000
people have visited the museum.

Founder Paley, also the Chairman
of CBS-TV, says that he recognized
the need for a "concerted and
organized preservation effort" in
1966. The following year the William
S. Paley Foundation conducted
studies on the feasibility of a major
permanent facility. The National En-
dowment on the Arts supported this
research endeavor with a matching
grant.

Since its triumphant inception the
Museum has been enthusiastically
supported by all of the networks,
public broadcasting, the National
Association of Broadcasters, and
several distinguished independent
broadcasters. Ahern is now permitted
to request up to 300 hours each of
TV and radio and broadcasting from
each of the three networks every
month. She anticipates owning
approximately seven thousand TV
shows and 150,000 radio broadcasts
by the end of 1980.

Most of the present selections have
not been shown publicly since their
original airing, and a great many are
from the first five years of large-scale
TV broadcasting, 1948 to 1953. The
Museum features Joe McCarthy's self-
defense on "See It Now," Fred Allen's
"Town Hall Tonight," and uncut
telecasts of the Kennedy-Nixon
debates. Also available for your
listening pleasure are some of the
earliest broadcasts in existence: Bing
Crosby's Rhythm Boys singing with
Paul Whiteman's orchestra, Lucky
Lindy's jubilant return to America
and Mom, and a quantity of speeches
made by FDR, the earliest of which is
dated 1920 (he was but a young
sprout of thirty-eight years). There
are also a number of fascinating and
horrible wartime radiocasts made by
pro-Axis Americans and Englishmen.
Hear 'em and weep.

At the museum, in the Broadcast
Study Center, I espied a technician
industriously watching TV at her desk
in the attractive, Jetsonesque room
where audio and video tapes are
presented. The architect responsible
for the pleasantly futuristic design is
Mr. John Beyer, head of a firm
bearing the suggestively homophonic
name of Beyer, Blinder and Bell. Said
museum technician seemed to be on a
first-name basis with some of the
visitors; later she told me that several
members of the museum arrive every
day at lunchtime to watch a favorite
show. "We've got a couple of fanatics
who are systematically going through
all of the episodes of 'Playhouse 90'
and 'Studio One'," she confided. She
also profferred a list of the Most
Requested Tapes: The Beatles on "Ed
Sullivan," "The Best of Ernie
Kovacs," "Amos 'n Andy," and "Peter
Pan." My visual appetite whetted by
this tempting menu, I entered the
Index Room.

The Index Room contained peri-
odicals, a large central table, a wall
covered with file cabinets, and a
television. Onscreen Alistair Cooke
was graciously welcoming us all to
the museum. An introductory teletape
effectively communicated the diversity
of the material in storage, from
speeches of all the presidents of the
United States since radio waves have
filled the air, to the comedy routines
of Bert Lahr and Bea Lillie. It
described radio and TV productions
of classical drama, Judy Garland's
radio debut at the tender age of
twelve (as Ross MacDonald said, "I
don't believe that people know every-
thing at birth and forget it as they
grow older"—the early Judy is less
than spectacular) and a television
appearance by Arturo Toscanini who,
at 84, apparently hadn't forgotten a
damned thing. There aren't many
cartoons among the varied holdings,
except for made-for-TV animation
movies, but the Museum of Broad-
casting does maintain a library of rare
books and television scripts, as well
as books and periodicals on the
industry.

Visitors to the museum have ready
access to this taped wonderland. In
the Index room, one selects programs
from an extensive, computer-
generated file of index cards, and
reserves time at one of the custom-
designed broadcast consoles. In spite
of myself, I looked up Yale in the file
and found, in addition to two
unexplained tapes of old Hasty
Pudding shows from the 1930's, the
1957 Omnibus production of Owen
Johnson's Stover at Yale.

Secure in one of eight consoles,
each of which accommodates three
people, I settled in for a broadcasting
blitz. The museum technician on duty
locked the tapes into place, and I
attached one of the three sets of
headphones to my eager ears. Always
a sucker for Viennese schmaltz, I
listened to Romberg's operetta, The
New Moon. The romantic reverie I
fell into while listening to a quavery
soprano warble "Lover, Come Back
to Me" was harshly interrupted by a
commercial for Zlotnick's Furrier,
circa 1937, and that cattiest of feline
films, The Women.

I heard the ineffable and probably
inebriated John Barrymore give a
superb reading of Hamlet's soliloquies
in a rather absurd 1937 radio show
entitled "Streamlined Shakespeare."
Ah, if only he had had a better
editor! Stover at Yale, purporting to
detail "the pretensions of college life,"
was introduced by the ubiquitous
Alistair Cooke, who termed it "odd
and funny...a period piece." The
show's set was painted and so phony
as to be extremely suggestive of the
actual campus, although a "set" of
Yale is almost redundant. According
to one of Johnson's Yalies, Yale "is
the kind of college where a man stands
on his own two feet, square against the
wind."

Freshmen of yesteryear were also
advised to "Study the first year and get
it out of the way." With delighted
horror, we see the happy-go-lucky
sadism of the class cut-ups and learn
that "It's just as easy to know the right
crowd as the wrong"—but so much
less fun! Other memorable Stover
quotes included, "Be nice to
everyone—but not too nice until you
find out where they stand."

I talked with the affable Lawrence
Bergreen, assistant to the president of
the Museum, and toured the ultra-
modern sound-filtering room, with its
classic space-ship control board of
sound filtering devices. It is used in
the delicate process of preparing the

Some gold-stone fins
But they sank away
From the waffled shallows

From nature I gleaned
Some hope of rice
But it edged deep away
In sunk stone bowls

So then I asked
For bowls and fins;
I asked me a hand
That could startle them back

I guessed me his hand, that could gather bowls open.

When I had asked

museum stores, one for use and the
other for preservation and duplication;
the medium lends itself to cloning.
Radio programs frequently come from
the 18-inch disks on which they were
first played, while TV tapes are made
from kenescopic films or from earlier
tapes. The storage room, which,
according to the press kit, "preserves
the treasures of more than a half
century of broadcasting," is a
climate-controlled, fire-proff vault:
the museum is a veritable Beinecke of
Broadcasting. All holdings are cross
indexed by computers, storage and
retrieval systems are sophisticated and
oh-so-up-to-date. One hour of
broadcasting time on a video or audio
cassette takes up less space than a
single book.

Recently the Museum became
the largest radio archive in the world
when NBC donated 140,000 hours of
radio broadcasting to the 1500 hours
of radio and TV previously acquired
by curator Mary Ahern. The building
also houses a collection of broad-
casting memorabilia: scripts dating
back to the 'twenties, periodicals, and
books dealing with the two media are
among the treasures stored there.
Television has been blamed for
everything from the breakdown of the
nuclear family to a proportion of
illiteracy among young Americans that
can only be described as Bionic.
Comedian Fred Allen once said that
"Thanks to television, the next gener-
ation will be born with four eyes and
no tongue...television is a triumph of
equipment over people." It is an
intimate medium, close-up and closed
in, yet its influence is vast. Nicholas
Johnson, former Federal
Communications Commissioner,
reports that "95 per cent of all
American homes have one television
set, 25 per cent have more than one.'
Television's influence, coupled with
the selectivity of the medium make it
doubly powerful: TV makes the news
through its editorial choices, allowing
the views of a few hundred people to
affect millions.

The Museum of Broadcasting also
exerts an important selectivity: its
choice of broadcasting specimens is
destined to become history, since any
speech Ahern. acquires is emphasized,
probably inordinately, as history.
Ahern, a graduate of Radcliffe, served
in the Chemical Warfare Service of
the U.S. Department of Defense.
Museum president Paley worked as
Deputy Chief of the Psychological
Warfare Division of Supreme Head-
quarters of the Allied Expeditionary
Forces in World War II.

Many of the most interest-
ing things on TV today are the
advertisements created specially for it,
and the perenially popular TV play,
Twelve Angry Men, succeeds because
the sequestered jury fits well in the
claustrophobic setting of a twenty-
inch screen. According to critic
Gilbert Seldes, "We are human and,
given a chance, we might still create
an art form of television." It is just
beginning to achieve recognition; even
Beinecke is preserving scripts written
by Emmy award winning TV writer
John Vlahos.

Can a medium controlled by busı-
nessmen realize a future as an art
form? The work of truly innovative
video artists is beyond the range of
television's popular culture and has
not been included in this archive of
"broadcasting" history. But the
museum has saved some of the
unqualifiedly great chapters of the
Old Testament of this extraordinary
religion. Frank Capra wrote that
"This monster is a new god! An
enchanting god giving rise to a
new, raging mystique built upon the
twitching stimuli of zap, leap, flip,
and break. All other gods are past,
dead."

The Museum of Broadcasting is
openfrom noon to five p.m. Tuesday
through saturday. a $1 contribution is
requested of those who are not ready to
make a lifetime commitment to the
new god.

Computers:
The Secret Behind the Secret Code

With the rapidly decreasing cost of
sophisticated electronic circuitry, the
day is not far off when it will be
financially possible to send informa-
tion by "electric mail" over public
channels, instead of the pen-and-
paper medium currently favored by
the U.S. Postal Service. Recent
advances in cryptography, the art of
secret cipher-coding of messages, have
assured that this mail will only be
decipherable and readable by its
intended recipient. The proof of this
assertion comes from the "purest"
subjects in mathematics, algebra and
number theory, as well as the
theoretical area known as "compu-
tational complexity". Finally, we will
all have pre-programmed, special-
purpose personal computers to do
this enciphering and deciphering, and
these machines will most likely be
cheap enough to get free in a box of
Cheerios. Although this would seem
to insure perfect equality of security
for all, in the highest traditions of
democracy, the U.S. Government is
extremely upset by the recent break-
throughs in cryptography. It's OK for
us, sure. But if the Russians figure
out how to do it, as the argument
goes, the National Security Agency
and their friends, the C.I.A., will be
unable to keep up with Leonid
Brezhnev's latest moves.

Codes and Keys

Coding messages is a very old
business, as is the task of code
breaking. Caesar made use of what
are now called "Caesar ciphers" which
work by cyclically "shifting" the
letters of the alphabet. A 3-shift, for
instance, would code the letter A as
D, B as E, and so forth. (A 1-shift on
HAL, the name of the computer in
the movie 2001, produces IBM. Kinda
makes you wonder, don't it?) The so-
called "key" to the code is the
distance of the shift; once that is
known, the code is broken.

Another more secure cryptographic
system is the transmission of private
key for a specific message. This key
would be a list of random numbers as
long as the message to be transmitted.
The key is delivered to the recipient
of a message, followed by the message
itself. The key describes a special
Caesar cipher for each letter in the
message. A key 9 4 7 10, for
example, followed by the message
LSKO, is deciphered as CODE, since
counting 9 letters backwards (alpha-
betically) from L yields C, 4 letters
back from S is O, and so forth.

Properly executed, the one-time key
can only be broken by random
guessing. This is the cryptographer's
dream. But there are a lot of other
difficulties. The amount of corres-
pondence doubles since very long
keys must be transmitted for each
message. The key could be intercepted
and copied before it reaches the
recipient, and the message decoded
easily. And if a lot of messages are
being sent, the problem of syn-
chronizing the proper keys with their
associated messages becomes very
complicated. For extended communi-
cations between a large number of
parties, the one-time key system is a
hopeless mess.

One Way Functions

The inspiration for the first major
breakthrough in cryptographic re-
search came from Whitfield Diffie
and Martin Hellman of Stanford
University. Their work appeared in
"New Directions in Cryptography"
(IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory, November 1976). Diffie and
Hellman propose a cryptographic
technique called the "public key
cryptosystem" which relies on a group
of coding functions called "one-way
trapdoor functions." These functions
are easy to carry out, but like a
trapdoor, very difficult to reverse.
The characteristics for a good one-
way trapdoor function are the
following:

1. All messages are simply coded into
integers by changing A to 01, B to
02, and so on. Then we only have
to "code" and "decode" large
numbers.

2. There are two encoding and de-
coding procedures f and g which
inverses of one another. If a text
is simply coded into a number N,
we encode the message by sending
the number M = f(N), and M is
decoded by computing g(M) =
g(f(N)), which (if our coding
procedures work) must be N.
Therefore g(f(N)) = N. Since
encoding and decoding are es-
sentially the same kind of opera-
tion, changing one number to
another, it is also true that
f(g(N)) = N.

3. The encoding and decoding pro-
cedures f and g can both be done
quickly.

4. The "trapdoor" condition: Given
the procedure f, it is compu-
tationally infeasible for anyone to
break the code and derive g.

With these conditions, it is easy to
describe an efficient communications
system. Every user A who wishes to
participate in this message sending
scheme has his own encoding and
decoding machines. Let's call them f
and ga. User A makes his encoding
device f public and sends one to all
his friends with the following mes-
sage: "If you want to send me some
electronic mail, type it into your
electric message sender and encode it
with my fA machine just before you
mail it." His decoding device,gA,
however, he keeps a secret, so only he
has a copy of it. This way, no one
besides A will be able to decode
messages sent to A.

Computer Crime and
Digital Signatures

The single problem with this design
is that it is only secure at one end.
When B sends a message to A, it is
clear that only A can read it. But it is
still possible that B did not send the
message, for another individual C
could be impersonating B and writing
messages in B's name.

It is this loophole that has been
exploited in an increasingly popular
public offense known as computer
crime, namely ripping off with
machines for fun and profit. An
excellent summary of such criminal
exploits can be found in a two-part
series which appeared in the New
Yorker this summer ("Annals of
Crime (Computers - I and 11),"
August 22, 1977 and August 29,
1977). Consider a bank that has a
computerized account system. If a
bank teller can learn to impersonate
the bank president on the computer,
the teller can learn the balance of
special accounts, shift money from
one account to another (which in-
volves a mere change of numbers
stored in computer memory), and
generally make a mess of things. In a
bank without a computer system of
this sort, such activity would be
impossible. First, the bank teller
doesn't look like the bank president,
so personal attempts would obviously
fail if he tried to ask the accountant
anything. Second, a written request
would probably fail, since those in the
know would see that the signature at
the bottom of the bank president's
purported request was not authentic.
In either case the fraud might easily
be traced back to the bank teller.

The clever solution to this problem
of anonymity is what Diffie and
Hellman call "digital signatures".
Here is how it works: Suppose B
wants to send A a message N. B has a
public encoding device fs (of which A
and everyone else has a copy) and a
secret decoding device ga. Similarly,
A has a public encoding device f
(which B knows) and his own
decoding device ga, also secret. To
send the message N, B first encodes
the message with f, and then codes
the result with his own device ga, and
sends the message g(f(N)). When A
receives the message, he first decodes
it with B's public coder fs, and then
gets fA(N), as fe and ga are mathe-
matical inverses. A then applies his
private decoding device ga to fa(N).
and out comes the message N!

This method is absolutely secure.
The reason is that when B sent the
message to A, he used his secret
coding device gs. For someone to
impersonate B, they would have to
figure out how to derive gs from f.
and this should be next to impossible.
Coding a message with your own
secret g-machine is a way of "signing"
the message, because no one else can
duplicate that coding procedure. Such
a public key cryptosystem can resist
the strongest form of cryptographic
code breaking, the "chosen plaintext
attack."

The secret of the one-way trapdoor
function is pretty much out of the
bag. The details of the prime number
implementation (as mentioned by
Martin Gardner in the "Mathematical
Games" section of Scientific Ameri-
can, August 1977) can be found in a
paper called "On Digital Signatures
and Public-Key Cryptosystems"
(Technical Memo 82, April 1977),
available for 35 cents and a stamped
addressed envelope by writing to Dr.
Ronald Rivest, Laboratory for Com-
puter Science, MIT, 545 Technology
Square, Cambridge, Mass. 02139.

Yes, for a mere 35 cents, you too can
create unbreakable codes in the
privacy of your own home. Don't
rush for your checkbook, though. At
last count, Rivest had received on the
order of two thousand requests for
this paper, as yet unanswered. Why is
Professor Rivest such a poor corres-
pondent? Because of the National
Security Agency.

The explanation for this state of
affairs gained public attention in a
front-page New York Times article
(October 19, 1977), entitled "Scien-
tists Accuse Agency of Harassment
Over Code Studies." A source at the
National Science Foundation, which
funds much of the research described
here, complained that NSA was
engaging in "systematic, bureaucratic
sniping" in an attempt to control this
research. The article appeared a week
after a conference on information
theory was held at Cornell University
in Ithaca, N.Y.

Several weeks before the con-
ference, its sponsors, the Institute of
Electric and Electronic Engineers
(IEEE), received a letter from one of
its members, Joseph A. Meyer. Ac-
cording to the Times, well-placed
scientists claim that Meyer is em-
ployed by the NSA. Meyer warned
that publication and distribution of
scientific papers on cryptography,
presented at the upcoming conference,
would be in violation of the 1954
Munitions Control Act, known cur-
rently as the Arms Export Control
Act. Lawyers from the IEEE, Stan-
ford, and MIT generally concurred
with this view. Scientific research is
routinely sent abroad to nations all
over the world, including the Soviet
Union. The new research could be
used to create security systems for
military communications that would
be impenetrable by the KGB, the
Soviet intelligence agency. Of course,
should the Soviets or any other
nation employ the same techniques,
the NSA and C.I.A. would be equally
unable to break the code. Hence
publicizing this research is roughly
synonymous with exporting arma-
ments to the military menace emanat-
ing from Moscow. This set the stage
for a rather tense conference.

At the conference, Diffie and
Hellman presented their results on
NP problems and their relations to
cryptography, as briefly described
above. Rivest of MIT also presented
the MIT group's results on prime-
number encryption. Under advice
from MIT lawyers, however, Rivest
said that he was unable to answer
questions on the MIT group's re-
search, although he read the paper he
had prepared for the conference. The
legal logjam over publication has also

NP Problems and
One-Way Functions

Naturally, the above argument assumes that we can really find functions like f and g. But exactly where can such "hard" functions be found? Diffie and Hellman suggest the use of a class of exceedingly difficult problems in "computational complexity", a sub-branch of theoretical computer science. These are known as "NP problems". The "NP" here means that a properly stated problem can be solved on a nondeterministic Turing machine in time bounded above by a polynomial function of the size of the problem description. Clear enough? What this means in English is that an NP problem has the following characteristic: Every problem has a "size" – let us say that the "size" of a problem is the length of its description. Depending on how we look at a problem, we may choose to count the number of letters or words needed to describe the problem, or the number of physical objects to which it refers, and so on. With an NP problem, the number of possible solutions is exponentially related to the problem size, say, for a problem of size x, there are 10<sup>x</sup> possible solutions. Furthermore, we do not have the faintest intuitive idea as to which possible solution will actually yield the correct answer, so we have to try them all!

One familiar NP problem occurs in symbolic logic and is called the "satisfiability problem". Given a statement in sentential logic (ask your roommate, he's in Philosophy 130a, a notorious flamer), which has symbols like "P", "Q", "R" (which stand for statements that may be true or false), such as

((P or not-Q) or R) and
(not-P or not-R),

is there some assignment of truth or falsity to P, Q, R that makes the whole statement true? Working it out will have to take 2<sup>8</sup> cases into consideration, which is done in what

quickly as it has. But controls on cryptographic research are ridiculous at this point, because too much research is already public. The MIT research is a perfect example. Practically all of its results have already been made public and published in one form or another. The only real problem that hasn't been explained in recent popularizations of the research is how to find the variable t having the needed number theoretic properties for a decoding algorithm. But given the other information known, the identity of t can be found by any half-baked algebraist. The very fast methods for finding out whether a number is prime, a key to the MIT implementation, have been published in several different technical journals. If any nation should wish to create a secure communication system that cannot be compromised by a crypt-analyst, the details are already public. The reaction of government intelligence agencies is too late to do anything but needlessly antagonize the scientific community.

Although the government's efforts to confound work in this area are essentially after the fact, it can exert a pronounced influence on researchers in the field. Even the publication of this article, which contains nothing that has not already been made public

there are n sentential variables (P, Q, R . . .) in the sentence, we have to try out 2<sup>n</sup> possible solutions. This is clearly an exponential problem.

The Knapsack Problem –
A Good One-Way Function

Diffie and Hellman use another NP problem called the "knapsack" problem to create a one-way trapdoor function. A case of the knapsack problem is the following: I give you a list of 100 random numbers and tell you that a subset of these numbers, added together, equals 490. Find me that subset of integers. There isn't any fast way to find this subset, you're going to have to check them all – there are 2<sup>100</sup> (approximately 10<sup>30</sup>) possible cases. Have a nice time looking!

Here is the essence of a trapdoor function: add up a subset of integers, and transmit the sum. This is easy. The "decoding" of the sum into the subset of numbers adding up to it is exponentially hard. If the random numbers were chosen carefully, the recipient of the message can decode the message easily. This is the "trapdoor" principle – the creator of the random list can use the "decode" key easily, but no curious crypt-analyst can figure it out.

Not to be outdone, a group of MIT researchers have come up with an alternate one-way trapdoor function that takes advantage of prime numbers and their bizarre properties. This new method is credited to the efforts of Ronald Rivest (Yale '69 for you alumni fans), Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman of MIT. Rivest is an associate professor of electrical engineering. This group has relied on a host of other results proved by a number of researchers. Here is how the prime number trapdoor works:

THE PUBLIC ENCODING KEY (what we called the "f" machine):
Every person P publishes two big

begins to tread on some extremely sensitive areas. The power of the immense government intelligence agencies is obviously a force to be reckoned with. Once a large bureaucracy commits itself to a policy of this sort, it is difficult to arrest the motion of systematized suppression.

On the other hand, one wonders what we're actually trying to hide. At a time when there is much criticism of the Executive's unrestricted power to classify anything, and lawsuits pending to release classified information (for instance, present litigation to obtain documents related to the Rosenberg case), why should we be trying to make things even more secret? Perhaps we should make all the federal data-banks public, let all the supposedly secret, private, and scandalous information on millions of Americans go public, and have a real housecleaning. But if we admit that there are certain ideas and communications which are logically private, if the governments and intelligence agencies of the world have a right to keep secrets, then so do the rest of us. Paradoxically, the government is trying to make a secret of a system which would make secrecy democratic.

Harry Mairson is a senior in Calhoun.

prevented release of the MIT technical memorandum advertised in Scientific American. Finally, the threat of prosecution dissuaded several postdoctoral students from presenting results at the conference.

Now what exactly can the National Security Agency do to restrict research on code theory? As you might have guessed, an awful lot. The NSA can prosecute researchers under the Munitions Control Act. Tenured faculty researchers would most likely be defended by their universities, but such harassment would create tremendous problems for junior faculty and graduate students in the field.

Secondly, as is alleged in the Times article, the NSA could threaten the National Science Foundation to cut off funding for these projects. This writer has independent verification of such activity. Naturally, the NSA has not had a great deal to say about the matter.

At the present time, the government has not moved to classify this research. It has moved to constrain and control its development, in a manner reminiscent of the restrictions of publication of physics research in the 1930's and 1940's.

Perhaps the NSA and other involved government agencies did not expect the subject to develop as

message N to P, raise N to the s-th power, divide it by r, and transmit the remainder. Mathematically, we write this as

E(N) = N<sup>s</sup> modulo r.

The number r is the product of two very large primes, p and q, which are kept secret. The computation E(N) can be done very quickly.

THE PRIVATE DECODING KEY (what we called the "g" machine before): Take the encoded message M, raise it to the t-th power, divide it by r, and the remainder should be N. This can be expressed as

D(M) = M<sup>t</sup> modulo r.

The number t depends on the values of p and q, which are kept secret. Knowing t, D(M) can also be quickly calculated.

The trapdoor principle here is that while it is computationally easy to find out if a very large number is prime, it is (at least by present knowledge) practically impossible to find all the prime factors of a large number. The MIT researchers picked s = 9007 and r to be a 129 digit number that, if printed here, would almost certainly be incorrectly typeset. The number r is the product of two 64-digit and 65-digit prime numbers.

How can we find out if a very large number p is prime? At first glance this would seem to be a difficult question to solve. But recent investigations by Gary Miller (currently at the University of Rochester) and Michael Rabin (Hebrew University), among others, have shown that it's not as tough as it's initially cracked up to be. Using a variety of classical mathematical arguments including the use of Fermat's Theorem (one of my favorite theorems) and the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (the unextended version is good enough for me, thanks), both conjectured over a century ago, it has been shown that finding primes as big as 2<sup>200</sup> is still easy. In fact, a MIT computer programmed with the correct algorithm found such a prime in less than a minute.

Taluscope

Talus was the best guard anywhere;
his record-breaking total of more that a
,hundred crushed, burned, and sunken
ships will probably never be matched.
Now he wasn't the sort of man to go
around town saying things like, "Talus
here. I'm big. I'm mean." Not at all.
Of course, he never really went around
town at all, seeing as how he lived on
the island and never had any dealings
with ordinary folks, except when he
killed them.
He was pretty quiet, most of the
time, as big as six regular men, and
strong as a whole navy. But he didn't
kill for pleasure, and not to satisfy an
ugly temper. It was just his job, and he
had been made for it. In his younger
days he would use what free time he
had relaxing in the shallows, watching
clouds and stars, peaceful things,
maybe to make up for the
ship-smashing.
He wasn't really so big as you might
have heard, what with stories about
him tossing around ships and eating
people whole. Usually a stranger's ship
would sail around to the east side of
the island. There was a nice strip of
sand and a little bay that was protected
by a rocky cliff about a hundred feet
tall. Well, Talus had him a cave half
way up, and he could watch a good bit
from his front door. When he spotted
a speck on the sea, he'd climb to the
top of his bluff and wait, maybe catch
a nap while he had time. But when
that ship pulled into the calm water,
Talus would take a running jump and
come shooting down like a comet.
When he got bored with his bronze
ball dive, he would make some fancy
flip or twist, then bore right on
through the ship, fingertips first,
straight as a plumb. Of course, if his
jumping off place wasn't handy, he
could always break a ship in half with
one well-aimed boulder.
There's something else about Talus
nobody seems to know, and that's that
he had him a wife. Sort of a wife, more
like a servant, really, named Lysia. She
was bronze, too, but her color was
lighter, more twinkly than Talus. Very
petite, for a metal woman, maybe ten
feet, twelve feet at the most, but
goodly portions, as they say. It seems
that some witch over in Chelaan
wanted to outdo Vulcan, and maybe
she felt sorry for lonely old Talus, but
whyever for, she built Lysia, a worthy
mate for a creation like he was.
Lysia would wait in their cave while
Talus did his guarding, she would keep
him company while he waited on his
cliff, maybe she changed his oil, I
don't know. She did save him from
being alone, and she was not afraid of
him. But they had a problem.
The night he died, he spent a while
over on the southwest beach. He
wasn't practicing his dives, not sitting
quiet or waiting for the moon to pop
out from behind a cloud. That night
he stormed around like the old Volcant
Daddy himself, tearing loose parts of
the shore and heaving them in all
directions. He yelled, "Curse
Vulcan!" and "Blazes for Chaalia!"
over and over (I think Chaalia must
have been Lysia's witch mamma), and
the whole place shook and echoed.
Sometimes he might toss chunks of
earth for exercise, but only for a
change, as cranky Minos didn't
appreciate having his pile of dirt
squandered away.
This doesn't much sound like the
calm type I was talking about, but he
was due for a little tantrum after his
set-to with Lysia. That was earlier in
the night, and their voices got louder
and louder till I could hear plain as
day. First thing I could make out was
Talus, saying, "I am bronze, woman,
not flesh," a nasty sound in him.
But quick and loud as you please,
she answered back, "And I am bronze
and woman, man.'" Now on paper it's
hard to tell you how mean she was
acting, but the way she said "man"
was enough to make me wither even
further into my hiding place, and
Talus, he seemed to take it for an
insult, too. There was a deep crash,
like maybe he punched a hole in their
living room wall, and he just boomed,
"You are an acorn to this oak!"
"And you a mule to this mare," she
said, even and ornery. Now the way
they talked was funny to me, like they
were high-class strangers. But the way
words rang out of their mouths, with a
kind of instant echo, made everyone
stick clear in my head.
Lysia still was not afraid of him,
though he seemed changed, into the
bellowing bull of stories about him.
Then she softened up some, sounded
more like a real wife. "Talus, I am
sorry. You are a great, a very great
man, and I have loved you and served
you all of my life. But I am not you,
and not a great man." Nobody said
anything for a little bit, then she went
on.
"Vulcan did not mean for you to
have a mate, I know. But I need your
touch, your glance, whatever love there
is. A kiss, perhaps?"
"Perhaps the kiss of man would
serve you better." He stomped out of
the cave, stopped just outside, and
looked back for a second. "Or ass,
perhaps," he said. Then he took off,
going under me so close I could've
touched his head, but right on by he
went, like spurs were digging at him.
For a while I just lay low, till I heard
Lysia, alone in the cave, crying like a
real woman.
Let me back up a little, as you may
be confused about my being on this
island in the first place. I signed on
with Jason just before his long trip,
and he asked for too much to handle
more than once; I'm not saying he
didn't do his share, but he left a lot of
dirty jobs to the crew. Everybody was
scared of Talus, and Jason took that as
a challenge. Just couldn't abide sailing
past Talus without poking a spear in
that general direction.
So he handed me a spear and sent
me and one other fellow to kill Talus.
Can't imagine what he was thinking.
Drunk, maybe.
We rowed the whole way for fear the
moon might shine our sail at the giant,
and we pulled our little boat up on a
rocky beach somewhat north of the big
bay, figuring that's where Talus would
probably be watching. He was too
caught up in his woman problems to

notice us anyway.
From where we landed, the only way
to the rest of the place was over the top
of the bluff. I had to find him before I
could kill him, so my shipmate
guarded the boat, and away I climbed.
From the top, I couldn't see my
comrade or the boat; that was good.
On the way down the other side, I
heard the voices ringing from inside,
and I hid fast, near enough to hear the
fight, but too close to the cave's
opening for my liking.
It surprised me that somebody like
Talus would back off from a fight, and
with a woman at that, but from their
argument and the crying, I figured she
might be inclined to help me out. I
nudged my way into the cave, spear
point first, ready to hightail. Never saw
a prettier woman, or more pitiful.
"Excuse me," I said, and she looked
up slowly. "Are you... Mrs. Talus?"
That didn't seem quite right, but
surely only a wife could talk to a giant
the way she did. She smiled at
something, the spear still poking
around in front of me, or maybe the
question, and said, "Talus has no
woman, nor will he have."
"Does that mean you want to get off
this rock?"
She stopped her crying, and very
ladylike, said, "Whatever I shall find
apart from this island will be island as
much as here I find. I can stay no
more." Still that funny way of talking,
still ringing right in my head, but I
gathered she wanted to leave Talus.
Very polite, I asked her if she wanted
to make a deal, that she could sail with
us if she'd tell me how to handle old
Talus.
At first she couldn't warm up to the
idea. She told me not to even think
about killing him, that he was really a
fine man; she was the one I should
blame. Well, who knows, but I
believed her about Talus having some
good in him. She told me how
different it had been before he started
brooding, and about his fancy diving,
how he liked the stars and tried not to
step on the seashells because they were
pretty.
But after all, I had a job to do, and I
kept after her about Talus' weak spot.
Finally, she said, "To betray his
secret's to betray nothing; you may
know how he can die, but also know
your weakness. He will never allow you
to kill him."
Talus could be killed, she admitted,
by pulling some kind of plug out of
him. Then all of his life-juice or
whatever would run out, and he'd die.
"So where's the plug?"
She stood up, but seeing as she's
kind of tall for me, she got on her
knees so we'd be more face to face, and
pointed down at my crotch. "There."
"You mean his..." I was still
looking for a good word, but she went
on.
"Desire and life are held in him
there, by a button, most small, and yet
in essence larger than himself. From
my most willing womanhood he's
suffered much; a little man would not
get even near enough to see it." I was
still staring down where she had
pointed; came close to asking her how

Talus managed some certain things
(one in particular), but I figured he
couldn't, at least not without killing
himself.
"Right. Yes. Well, look, there's a
little boat hidden on that beach over
the hill. Tell the fellow there that I
sent you, and wait there. And try not
to scare him too much." She left.
All the way across the island you
could hear Talus and feel the ground
shaking. Maybe he wasn't quite as big
as in the stories, but he sure made up
for it in volume.
I started toward the sound of his
voice, but before a mile was up, the
ruckus stopped. He was calming down
some, maybe he'd go to sleep and I
could sneak up on him. Of couse, he
never slept, but I had to keep my
spirits up.
Then he was running; I felt each
bounce and jolt as he headed for
home, toward his cave; toward me for
that matter. So I turned myself around
and started running, too. Hid myself
in his cave just as Talus started up the
cliff. He called out Lysia's name while
he climbed, didn't sound mad
any more; desperate, if anything. He
didn't stop at the cave, just kept
climbing and calling to Lysia until he
reached the top.
Didn't make any sense of it till I
crept outside for a quick look. Just
beyond the still water in the bay, our
boat's small sail was shining away in
the moonlight; my friend Linneus had
abandoned me. Standing toward the
front of the boat, like a figurehead,
was Lysia. Even at a good distance you
couldn't miss her.
And missing her seemed like the last
thing on Talus's mind. He tore a huge
hunk of stone from the cliff and raised
it over his head. All quiet now, and I
couldn't see his face, but the outline of
his arms with the boulder towered over
me, clear against the moon. He tossed
that rock with such a snap it sailed out
twice as far as the boat, then crushed a
piece of driftwood and smashed into
the sea. The driftwood was gone, and
the only other target was our boat.
Talus backed away from the cliff's
edge, and I couldn't see him. I braced
myself to see him running off, diving
through Linneus, breaking the boat to
kindling.
After a minute or so he walked back
into view. Saw all of him, watched him
as he pissed into the ocean. Just what it

I watched as he went under, then
back to the clifftop, and I shouted and

Lysia, bronze and woman, wed
To Talus, unwed, bronze, and dead.
Took me a year to get off that island,
and it's a year since, but nobody seems
to know anything about Lysia. Maybe
she couldn't live without him after all,
and she's gone; all right. But these

Pollux and Jason and Medea, but none
of them were around when Talus died.
And Lysia was right-no little man like
me could've gotten close enough.

COMPUTERS AT YALE

"It's like having a secretary who can type forty different company
reports from dictation simultaneously, and answer two phones
whenever they ring without missing a beat."

Computers at Yale. There are a lot
of them. They're concentrated in two
places: the Computer Center and the
Computer Science Department, but
just about every department in the
University has at least one or two little
ones. The Computer Center computers
are crunching all day long at little
administrative tasks that it would take
human secretaries ten to twenty times
as long to do. So those computers are
primarily being used as administrative
secretaries. The computers at the
Computer Science Department are
used primarily for research. Even
though Yale's Computer Science
Department is relatively small, there
are about five major factions within it,
competing for time on the computer,
or "the machine" as they refer to it.
And now a brief rundown of each
faction with a blurb on what I think
their research is aimed at.
Systems: This involves research into
computers themselves, how to make
them run more efficiently, how to do
things like attaching about forty
terminals to a single computer, seating
a mixture of grads and undergrads at
them, and having "the machine"
respond to all of them at once, even
though they're all doing different
things. It's like having a secretary who
can type forty different company
reports from dictation simultaneously
and answer two phones whenever they
ring without missing a beat.
Numerical Analysis: The "number
crunchers," as the rest of the
department calls them, are trying to
figure out new applications of fast
computer programs to analysis of
scientific data and data analysis.
Complexity: They tried to explain it
to me, but I don't understand.
Artificial Intelligence: These guys
are trying to get the computer to do
things that a human can do. Like
reading a newspaper and
understanding it. Understanding it?
How do you know if it's understood it
or not? Well, first it will give you a
summary of what it read, in its own
words, and then you can ask it
questions about what it read, and it
answers them!
At Yale, all the Al research is
directed by Roger Schank, one of the
biggest names in the field. Schank
feels that the best way to make a
machine act intelligent is to make it do
exactly what people do, as close as we
can figure out.
At an international conference on
Artificial Intelligence at M.I.T. this
summer, Schank was the chairman of
the "Natural Language Processing"
session. In Artificial Intelligence (AI)
jargon, a "Language" can be either
"natural", like English or Latin, or
"artificial", like Fortran, which is a
language designed for computers. The
Al lab isn't very interested in artificial
languages (which are primarily the
province of the Systems people.) They
are, however, interested in English,
and how people use it to communicate
with each other and understand what
they read.
Take this sentence, for example: "I
hit Roger Schank in the mouth."
When you read that, you not only
understand the physical action that I
performed by "hitting," you also
know that I must have been next
to him before I could hit him, and that
he was probably amazed that I would
do such a thing, (you are too: you
probably don't believe that I really did
it), and you expect me to explain the
action, or justify it, and you expect
Roger to hit me back, or order me out
of his office, or call for help or
something. You know all that just
from my saying that I hit him.
Schank and his group are trying to
write computer programs that will read
a sentence like that and make the same
inferences that you made when you
read it. In fact, they have a system,
called "SAM", which can actually read
newspaper stories and understand
them. For example, take this lead
story, straight off the UPI wire:
"An Iberian tanker today struck a
reef off the coast of Florida, spilling
tons of oil into the Atlantic Ocean.
Helicopters are keeping the spreading
spill under observation, and it is not
yet known whether nearby beaches will
be affected."
SAM knows all sorts of things about
oil spills, and tankers, and has a
smattering of geography, so it can
answer questions about the story, like
"What caused the oil spill?". The
answer SAM prints back is "A tanker
struck a reef, and the tanker probably
cracked open, and the oil leaked out
the crack." Not an answer full of
insights, but certainly displaying an
understanding of the physical events
that took place. SAM is an expert on
physical events. It understands stories

should be directed. The main idea is to
see if we can make a machine act
"intelligent", although no one really
agrees on what constitutes intelligence.
The programs that have been
written so far in the Al field have been
static, like SAM reading a certain type
of story from a newspaper. It can read
the story, but it can't learn from it.
SAM itself is no different after reading
a story than before. It can't make any
new inferences, or alter its point of
view. Rick Granger, a Computer
Science grad student, is working on an
addition to SAM that allows it to figure
out a new word from context. For
example, if you read that President
Carter went to Bagawaga to establish
diplomatic relations there, then you'd
know that Bagawaga was probably a
country, even though you never heard
of it before. The reason you can do that
is that you've already heard a thousand
stories dealing with Presidents and
diplomatic relations, and you know
that in general, countries are the things
that people go to and establish
diplomatic relations with. So you
interpret the story in terms of other
stories like it that you've seen

about car crashes, earthquakes, oil
spills, floods, and other disasters. It
does not understand the human
intentionality behind such stories. Like
"why did the driver lose control of the
car?" or "how will people react to the
damage?". However, there's another
program at the AI lab called "Pam"
which understands exactly that sort of
thing. PAM reads stories about things
like robberies, and understands the
motivations behind people involved in
such activities. It's not going to solve
any serious sociological problems about
why people perform robberies, but it's
doing a lot to augment scientists'
understanding of what processes
underlie the human understanding
process itself.
Al is a relatively new field, and
various people in the field have
different ideas about how research

previously. That's exactly how SAM
reads stories. In fact, that's the only
reason it can understand them in the
first place: by having all that built-in
knowledge about the situation that the
story is describing.
Yale graduate students are currently
working on projects that tap
knowledge, enabling SAM to figure
out words from context, just as we do.
If the computer read that story, it
would think that Bagawaga was a
country after it read it; it would
actually know a new piece of
information. Other projects include
general learning programs that will
enable the computer to talk about
what it's learned, and to learn things
explicitly, as well as implicitly like
SAM.

Re-Viewing Jean-Luc Godard, or
Why is This Man Smiling?

the new journal, december 6, 1977

A query some years ago to the editor of
the *NYTimes* Arts and Leisure section
suggesting an article on the Godard
series that had played at the Carnegie
Hall that summer elicited a polite no,
thanks anyway, there's no news peg.
I suppose there really wasn't,
although the chance to see the
near-complete works of any director in
order ought to merit some attention.
And Godard, well for lots of us
Godard wasn't just any director. I
offered a tentative title on the order of
"The most important director of the
sixties as seen from the vantage point
the seventies." I realized later that
their editor was new, and maybe I
should have explained who Godard
was.

Because Godard was more than just
the most "important" director of the
sixties, in say the same way that
Norman dello Joio could be called the
most important composer of the
thirties. Cinematically Godard came
very close to being the sixties. (Of
course a number of the old guard did
some of their finest work in the same
period, and I wouldn't want to say that
even the best Godard was necessarily
better than *Torn Curtain*, *El Dorado*,
or *The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence*.
But those were retrospective winter's
tales, and the sixties were more notable
for their newfangledness than their
backward glances.) Even at the time
many of us felt that the decade was
defining itself cinematically through
the dazzling and precocious assurance
of Godard, and looking back it's
possible to see even more clearly now
has almost all his films opened up
possibilities, showed not just where he
might go next, but where movies could
follow. That's what made his films
look so different when you saw them a
couple of years later. Andrew Sarris
probably said it best,

"But Godard was a very special
case... The pattern was always the
same. Each new film would be assailed
by his detractors as his biggest mess
yet, and even his friends would look a
little uncomfortable. A year later the
same film would look like a modern
masterpiece, and two years later like
the last full-bodied flowering of
classicism."

And now that the great creative
period seems to be over, we can look
back again. The view has changed a
bit. The narrative dislocations of
*Pierrot le Fou*, for example, no longer
seem to intimidating as they once did.
What Richard Roud called Godard's
"realism" seems less important now
than the various stylizations, and these
too seem less "abstract", to use the
other pole of Roud's "dialectic." I
don't know whether Godard would
agree, though he might. He once
answered an interviewer's suggestion
that *Pierrot* had a lot of blood in it
with "No, there's a lot of red."

The point of several of his pictures
looks different too. *La/Une Femme
Mariee* seems less a generalized
indictment of that cliche of European
filmmaking (or at least American
critical reaction to it) "the
meaninglessness of modern life" than
a specifically pre-feminist work. *Pierrot
le Fou* seems less and less about its
admittedly gorgeous North by
Northwest-like escape from the lights
and rooftops of Paris to the cote
d'azur, and more about its close-ups of
Anna Karina.

But for me the key to Godard seems
to be lurking somewhere in the
background of Sarris' remark. And
that I take to be something very akin
to nostalgia. It's not a nostalgia for the
past, except perhaps for his own artistic
salad days. Nor am I equating it with
Godard's fabled "romanticism",
although that's a bit closer. What I
sense in Godard, and what moves me,
is his incredible awareness of
possibilities of the movies his movies
might have been, would like to be,
could never be.

Example: At the end of his early
film *Bande a Part*, one of the two
heroes is shot after a suspenseful chase.
The approach to that moment is
extremely close in tone to the ending
of Truffaut's *Shoot the Piano Player*,
only... Only Godard just can't do it.
Instead, short-circuiting the emotions
of the scene, he has Arthur run around
comically, like a chicken with its head
cut off-a grotesquely funny dance of
death.

The camera never moves while
Arthur runs to the exact left edge of
the frame, then to the exact right
edge-as if there were chalk marks on
the ground and this were a Minnelli
musical. Unable to believe in the
conventions of his story, Godard
evades, and switches genres. It's like
the moment in *Pierrot Le Fou* when
Karina says "Fin du roman Jules
Verne; retournons au policier
deuxieme rang."

But *Bande a Part* was planned as just
such a genre movie, a policier
deuxieme rang. It was to be his first big
hit after *Breathless*. It didn't turn out
that way, of course. Godard couldn't
make it that way. He couldn't believe
in the emotions proper to the death of
one of his characters. Yet his films are
filled with a yearning for just such
genres, just such moments of feeling.
More than any other director I can
think of, Godard has had a very
self-conscious relationship to his
sources, whether in an individual story
or a genre. But this relationship had
become increasingly ironic,
increasingly one impossibility until,
clutching at straws, he latched on to
the Maoist rhetoric that fills his latest
films a true counsel of despair.

You can watch this happening
chronologically. That's what makes
each film of Godard's a "transition
film", as Ira Hauptman has pointed
out. Renata Adler said rather
laconically of *Les Carabiniers* that it
advanced the art of cinema "a step."
And in fact critics at the time tended to
emphasize the novelty of each film, to
see, if they understood them at all, the
doors each film was opening, even the
doors they were opening for cinema.
What seem more important now are
the doors each film was closing for
Godard.

That's what I meant by nostalgia-a
search for genres, feelings, certainties
to hold on to. (Two of his films open
with the heroine saying "Je ne sais
pas.") What makes this earch so
poignant is that these are usually the
conventions and feelings he was able to
believe in only a few films back. *Pierrot
le Fou* seems to wish it could believe in
love as simply as does *Une Femme est
Une Femme*, *Weekend* that it could
hold onto even the partial affirmations
of *Pierrot*.

That's why *Pierrot*, though in the
end, I think, less successful than his
other outdoor 'scope and color epic,
*Contempt*, is ultimately so much
more affecting. *Contempt*, with its
extensive use of classical illusion, its
heroic images of statues and Fritz
Lang, marks a tributary direction in
Godard's career. The value of *Fierrot*
by contrast has much to do with its
central place in that career. Martin
Rubin once called it

"One of those suicidal works
(comparable to Welles' *Lady from
Shanghai*, Sternberg's *Anatahan*,
Ford's *Seven Women*) in which a
director lays all his cards on the table
and afterwards must either completely
re-examine the nature of his art
(Godard, Welles), or else stop making
films altogether (Sternberg, Ford)."

But this is only especially true for
*Pierrot*; it holds, more or less, for all
his films.

Godard's situation was thus like that
of many of this characters. They too
often try to live their lives according to
past literary and cinematic models,
and, like Godard, they usually fail.
Anna Karina may be able to "danser
comme dans les musicales de
Hollywood," though she does it
without the hoped-for "choreographie
de Bob Fosse." But Arthur's romance
with Odille in *Bande a Part* can no
more be like Romeo and Juliet their
English teacher reads them than
Godard can in fact make a real policier
(or a real Hollywood musical)-any
more, in fact, than they can complete
their teacher's exercise of translating
the modern French back into the
original blank verse. (Of course Godard
is aware that even Romeo and Juliet
couldn't live their lives by the already
outdated Petrarchan love sonnet
conventions they chose to incarnate.)
"Send her to watch Johnny Guitar,"
says Belmondo of a lazy maid in *Perrot
le Fou*; but we know it won't help.

Richard Roud has described
Godard's career in a series of almost
happy dialectics. I think its more a
matter of painful paradoxes. Godard is
ironizing genres at the same time as he
wants to believe in them, just as his
heavy irony toward the Maoist student
heroes of *La Chinoise* can't conceal his
desire for the clarity of their
dedication, the simplicity of their
belief.

Godard couldn't help seeing the
contradictions: The terrible beauty of
his flaming car crashes; the visual
appeal of those cranes, bridges,
posters, and detergents he though were
destroying the Paris of 2 or 3 things;
the purity and justice of Bardot's
contempt in the film of that name, but
also the humane sadness of Piccoli's

And All
That Jazz

A long, narrow room, rows of
kitchen-type chairs, a
conspicuous-and-proud-of-it soda
machine, and a make-shift stage area
bring jazz home to the public in an
informal setting at New York City's
Jazz Museum. It is a mecca for all true
jazz lovers, founded by a small group
that calls itself the Hot Jazz Collective,
the kind of place that makes you want
to tap your feet and type your paper at
the same time. Live music and jazz
memorabilia are presented in an
easy-going atmosphere. During one
Friday afternoon jam session,
musicians walked in from the street
and either walked directly onto
stage, joining musicians already there,
or sat among the small, intent
audience for a few minutes before they
were invited to join the concert in
progress.

Before you settle down to the music,
you can look over the exhibits in the
museum which include photographs,
news clippings, old programs, letters
and other assorted memorabilia. Some
focus on a particular performer (Sam
Wooding and Rae Harrison were
recently featured), some on a particular
instrument and the musicians who

jazz.' The New York Jazz Museum is
aware that jazz is still a fledging art
form and has the flexibility to
document all genres.

The museum archives ane not open
to the public at this time. Only
members with adequate credentials
may sift through the files of documents
and artifacts, though the museum staff
is willing to assist anyone involved in a
serious study of jazz. An invitation to
participate in the museum is extended
to working jazz musicians, and Ruckert
encourages them to provide the
museum with resumes, photographs
and discographies for the collection.

The museum suffers from the
widespread problem of insufficient
funding. "Jazz is the bastard child in
America," she observed. Over the past
several years, the museum has had to
move several times because it couldn't
keep up with overhead expenses.
Potential contributors from large
corporations support the Opera and
the Philharmonic more readily than a
lessor known medium. "That's part of
their way of life and they understand
the necessity for it." Other museums
in the city have not offered to
incorporate the jazz archives into their
permanent collections.

There is no admission fee to the Jazz
Museum, only an unspecified and
entirely voluntary contribution.
Membership is available for students at
$8.-lifetime membership is $1000
per year. Jazz greats, such as Miles
Davis, a life-member, contribute
financially and musically.

The Jazz Museum's current financial
crisis has resulted in the temporary
cancellation of one of the museum's
best offerings: free Sunday afternoon
concerts by great jazz musicians. In
years past, Dizzy Gillispie, Teddy
Wilson, and many others have donated
their time and music, playing to
packed houses of friends of jazz. It is
not uncommon for jazz greats to stop
in at the museum on their way to or
from gigs in other parts of the country
(or the world) and play an impromptu,
unadvertised concert.

The museum holds regular weekly
jam sessions on Friday afternoons and
evenings, with groups from every part
of the jazz spectrum. On Saturdays
there are afternoon concerts, followed
by a "Get to Know the Artist'
program. The exhibits keep changing,
the archives keep expanding, and the
music puts you in touch with the
exxence of jazz.

The Jazz Museum is located at 230
West 54th St. A limited number of
membership forms are available on
campus. Call 20573.

brought life to it, and some celebrate a
genre or era of jazz. A table covered
with back issues of Downbeat and bins
of jazz records, including some Woody
Herman 78's, are available for your
perusal and purchase.

The museum's extensive archives are
its most distinguishing asset. Ann
Ruckert, one of the museum's
directors, has an indefatigable
enthusiasm for the museum's
collection of books, photographs, and
recordings. "We have an opportunity
to document an art form from its
inception...can you imagine what it
would be like if we had oral tape
histories of Michelangelo?" The jazz
museum in New Orleans offers only
memorabilia, and the archives at
Tulane University covers only the
relatively small genre of 'traditional

in the field, then strode off, muttering
obscenely about his rival, Santa Claus.
As the pitiful cries of the children
stuffed in Black Pete's jute bag (a
reminder that severe wickedness will
get you sent to Spain to work in the toy
factories) died off over the dyke,
Hermien mooed contentedly, for we
were alone together again. She sat
down, and I beside her, and she asked
of the wretched bastion of Eli where I
dwelt. I told her of Hoho, who she
seemed to remember as some distant
cousin of hers, of THE GAME ("all
that grass, wasted on brutes" was her
only comment), of the strike and my
consequent lack of milk and hygiene
("no wonder you look so preppish"
she grunted under her nostrils), of the
cold and the commercialism, acid
academic pressure and social
wastelands of aetherized patients.
Slowly, I sank into her comforting
udders, and in the end we could do no
more that stare off into the clear and
antineurotic geometry of the pastures,
the simple land of innocence I had so
foolishly left for Kant, cant, castration
and callousness. Slowly, the chocolate
letter melted in my mind, and I with
it, into the green and fruitful earth.

attempts to understand her. Enmeshed
in his Maoist rhetoric like Laocoon in
the coils of the snake, Godard will
probably never make another great
film. With ever increasing clarity,
Godard fought and finally surrendered
to the painful uncertainties and
contradictions that plagued him as, I
guess, they must plague all those fated
to embrace the world as an angel while
seeing it so clearly as a whore.

Dreyfus' wonderful performance
reaches its zenith during a sequence in
which he runs out of his home in a
paroxism of frustration after trying
repeatedly and unsuccessfully to
decipher this mystifying symbol.
Flinging himself frenziedly into the
darkness he pleads with the sky for
help.
These strivings to understand the
Shape are representative of Speilberg's
leitmotif of translation and
communication. The languages of
Math, Music, and Color are as integral
to the composition of the film as are
the linguistics of English, Spanish,
French, and Indian, all spoken in *Close
Encounters*. A charming moment
occurs near the conclusion when a
bemused scientist, busily engaged in
blipping sounds and tones to the
Flying Object overhead, queries in
English, "What are we saying to each
other?" The creators of the film might
have dealt more succinctly with this
universal question.
The production is sumptuous and
the director is a past master at the
depiction of crowds, landscapes, and
inanimate objects. John Williams'
exciting but excessive background
music thunders into the foreground
with inapprorpiate frequency. As the
French metaphysicist Lacome, Francois
Truffaut is, qualifiedly, cute.
Douglas Trumbull's encyclopedia
of spectacular special effects even
includes a marvellously petite U.F.O.
that must be the Bionic version of
Glinda's bubble, but Spielberg's
redundant insistence on illustrating
every nuance of meaning with a literal
visual correlary cripples the film's last
twenty minutes. Visitors from another
planet were portrayed unnecessarily
anyway—as minimally distorted
humans; I consider such
earthnocentricity revolting.
There is enough stellar material in
*Close Encounters of the Third Kind* to
provide a few hours of diversion. As a
visionary, however, Steven Spielberg is
so hopelessly earthbound that he
reduces the heavenly image of
transgalacic communion to that of a
mere Close Encounter Group.

Keith Jarrett

Keith Jarrett is a complex,
controversial musical
personality. Critics spend pages
speculating on his preferences in
audiences, back-up groups, record
companies, and his attitude toward the
contemporary music scene. He is an
artist whose music can't be
categorized. And to complete the
murky image, he's extremely
temperamental and seldom gives
interviews. Most critics believe that
Jarrett's career is on the upswing, and
therefore he is more saleable and
printworthy than ever.
In *Billboard* magazine terminology,
Jarrett has the ability to "cross
markets" in record sales. His eclectic
style appeals to jazz listeners, fans of
so-called "fusion" music like Weather
Report, all pianists, and even some
classical buffs. Albums like his *Koln
Concert* solo recording have received
5-star ratings from *Downbeat*
magazine and almost everyone else.
His solo recordings on the ECM label
have been his biggest commercial
successes in this country.
Jarrett is a classically-trained pianist
with effortless technique and a musical
conception influenced by many
sources, from folk songs to Debussy.
Even to the uninitiated listener, his
recordings can be entrancing. Though
influenced by the mainstream jazz
tradition, Jarrett is never just a jazz
player, and at times he is not even an
improviser. He has many of the
pretensions of a "serious composer."
With a set of conflicting
preconceptions, this writer went to
Woolsey Hall on November 10th to see
and hear Keith Jarrett's American tour
debut. The tour is somewhat unusual
in that Jarrett is playing with a group,
moreover, an all-European group
called Belonging. Norwegians Jan
Garbarek, Palle Daniellson, and Jon
Cristensen accompany the pianist. This
trio has earned a solid reputation in
Europe, and the combination of these
musical forces raised some speculation
before the New Haven concert. In
Jarrett's three previous visits to this
city, he played solo.
The presence of Belonging made
little difference in Jarrett's overall
performance, as the pianist's playing
completely dominated the ensemble.
Not only did he fill a large part of the
concert with extended solo
introductions and interludes, he
controlled the form and direction of
each piece. Total group interaction,
essential in this kind of free format,
was negligible. It sounded more like
three musicians trying to respond to
each other's monologues.
In his American tour debut at
Woolsey, Jarrett also used two
techniques which have become
standard practices in his concerts of the
last few years. The first consists of
hammering one note on the piano for
what seems like hours. When he finally
ceased the audience burst into
spontaneous applause, reminding me
of the man who kept hitting his head
against a brick wall because it felt so
good when he stopped. The second
technique involves using different
parts of the Steinway for percussion:
the strings, stool, lid, or anything else
within reach. What does it all mean? It
must mean something; it sounds
terrible.
Jarrett has said that while on stage,
he lets his subconscious mind take over
and tries to block out any conscious
thoughts. This means that almost
anything can happen in the long,
loosely-structured improvisations, and
this approach can produce inspired
moments felt by every listener. Too
often, it produces periods of uneven
quality and sheer boredom. Although
the Woolsey Hall audience was treated
to a few minutes of intense playing,
Jarrett spent twice as much time
fooling around, apparently waiting for
his subconscious to make the next
move. His concert recordings are
selected from hours of live tapes, so the
quality is consistently good. The
concert-goer doesn't have this luxury
of selection, and disappointing
experiences like the New Haven
concert are too often the result.
Perhaps his subconscious had a bad
night, perhaps his concerts need a little
more conscious direction. Maybe
Jarrett really doesn't like American
audiences.

Keith Jarrett left many questions
about the future of his tour
unanswered. He will probably remain
an enigma, and a particularly
frustrating one, especially for his older
fans. But enigma or not, knowing his
talent and potential, his New Haven
concert can only be called a
disappointment.

Dutch Treat

This is the second in a series of two
articles.

As my concorde jet slowly cruised
over the houses of Levittown into the
black smog of New York, I sat musing
whistfully and wishfully about my visit
with Hermien. I had promised
Hermien, when I left that unspoilt
Eden of lush tulips, that I would
always come back to see her on St.
Nicolaas, our Dutch national holiday.
(December 5). So I packed my
duffelbag and bookbag and winged
back to liberty, bringing her the paean
I wrote in the last issue of this gazette.
She was kind enough to notice, as soon
as I walked onto her pasture, the little
wrought-iron likeliness of her luscious
self that now dangles daily before the
deaf-and-dumb eyes of my fellow
undergraduates, enticing those poor
creatures so far removed from her
grace. After a fat and comforting hug,
which filled my nostrils once again
with her earthy scent, she set about
chiding me for my clothes. "Where are
your wooden shoes?" she mooed,
tapping her hoof on my new, but
carefully worn, Topsiders. "Those will
never do. And those pants. Really.
They're baggy and drab. And don't
think I don't see that nasty alligator
leering at me beneath that shirt.
Buttoned down, too." And with two
quick nibbles she tore the buttons off,
and to show her full disgust at my
appearance, she lifted her tail,
breaking several strings of my squash
racket without even aiming. Blushing,
I stammered something about doing as
Romans, then offered her her
chocolate letter. "At least you didn't
forget that, but you didn't bring me
any frozen yogurt," she said, quickly
devouring the chocolate 'H'. (For the
uninitiated and untapped: in
Holland, we give each other chocolate
letters at St. Nicolaas, just to remind
each other of who we are, for the letter
is the first letter of your first name).
"And here's yours," she said smiling,
handing me my 'A'. "And here's your
present." Decency does not permit me
to say what it was, but my heart and
parts of my body melted as I kissed her
eyes, and tears gently fell on her
steaming snout (it was pretty cold).
Just then, St. Nicolaas himself
appeared at the trough where we were
standing, allowing his white horse to
drink with that dreadful equine way
that those things do. The Stately
Spanish bishop, clad in red and white,
his tall hat swaying gently, his miter
tapping impatiently on the ground,
nodded once at me, then turned to one
of his black servants, motioning with
his gloved finger to hand him the
Great Book. Not finding me in it (I am
now a resident of Connecticut), he had
Black Pete give me a few lashes with his
bunch of twigs, as is the custom with
all naughty boys. Just for good
measure, he threw some candy around
